- Columns: 9
  - Features: customer name, customer e-mail, country, gender, age, annual Salary, credit card debt, net worth
  - Target: car purchase amount
- Data Types:
  - Float64: age, annual Salary, credit card debt, net worth, car purchase amount
  - Int64: gender
  - Object: customer name, customer e-mail, country
- Memory Usage: 35.3+ KB
- Missing Values: None

Sample Data (First 5 Rows)
--------------------------
- Martina Avila: net worth = 238961.25, car purchase amount = 35321.46
- Harlan Barnes: net worth = 530973.91, car purchase amount = 45115.53
- Naomi Rodriquez: net worth = 638467.18, car purchase amount = 42925.71
- Jade Cunningham: net worth = 548599.05, car purchase amount = 67422.36
- Cedric Leach: net worth = 560304.07, car purchase amount = 55915.46

Preprocessing
-------------
- Dropped: customer name, customer e-mail
- Encoded: country, gender (LabelEncoder)
- Scaled: Numerical features (StandardScaler)
- Feature Engineering: Added interaction term (annual Salary × net worth)

Customer Segmentation (K-means, 3 Clusters)
-------------------------------------------
- Cluster 0: 137 customers
- Cluster 1: 163 customers
- Cluster 2: 200 customers

Model Performance
-----------------
1. Linear Regression
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.10
   - R² Score: 1.00 (Perfect fit, possibly overfitting or data issue)
   
2. Random Forest Regressor
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3,966,716.96
   - R² Score: 0.96 (Explains 96% of variance)
   - Cross-Validation R² Scores: [0.9546, 0.9583, 0.9556, 0.9584, 0.9555]
   - Average CV R²: 0.96 ± 0.00 (Highly consistent)

Feature Importance (Random Forest)
---------------------------------
1. salary_networth_interaction: 0.4183 (41.83%)
2. age: 0.3745 (37.45%)
3. annual Salary: 0.1786 (17.86%)
4. net worth: 0.0144 (1.44%)
5. credit card debt: 0.0072 (0.72%)
6. country: 0.0058 (0.58%)
7. gender: 0.0013 (0.13%)

Key Insights
------------
- Random Forest outperforms Linear Regression with R² = 0.96 and lower MSE.
- Top predictors: salary_networth_interaction (41.83%), age (37.45%), annual Salary (17.86%).
- Linear Regression R² = 1.00 suggests potential overfitting or data leakage; investigate further.
- Customer segmentation reveals 3 distinct groups, with Cluster 2 being the largest (200 customers).

Recommendations
---------------
- Validate Linear Regression results (R² = 1.00 is suspicious).
- Use Random Forest as the primary model due to high accuracy and consistency.
- Focus marketing efforts on age and income-related factors, as they drive predictions.
